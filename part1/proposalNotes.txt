Section 1 - 500/1000:

Asteroids 3D Version:

Square arena
Player controls a spaceship entity around an arena.
Player can accelarate their
Camera sits just behind the user and follows movements the spaceship makes
Arena contains several asteroids that move around the screen
If an asteroid collides with another asteroid, they bounce off each other.


Controls: Forward - Accelerate

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justification 1000/2000:

Argument for mastery:

-Ship will require acceleration and deceleration rather than linear traversal

-Change of camera perspective from Asteroids adds a sense of urgency (Asteroids is seen more as an RTS, Dogfight relies more on reflexes).

-Pattern Matching --> Predict physics actions (collision resolution).

-Based on a high-score mentality
	TOF: "Physical challenges alone aren't fun. The feeling of triumph when you break a personal record is" --> Relate back to games.
	
---
Argument for Fantasy Element:
	TOF: "We also enjoy visceral experiences of various sorts -- these are often challenges to ourselves."

---
Argument for Nostalgia:
	
-Designed in mind of Atari Jaguar graphics (polgonal).
	TOF: Aesthetic Appreciation isn't always fun, but it's certainly enjoyable.
